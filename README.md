# Tech Policy Card Game

A card game, inspired by Fluxx, i.e. a game where the rules and win conditions change as you play the cards in your hand (just like life!). This game is developed around the concepts of internet health and on the issues and policies that we see in tech policy.


## Basic Play

- Everyone starts with 3 cards
- Initial play is  Draw 1, Play 1; 1 Goal to start.
- Anyone can join at any time

## 4 Types of Cards:

### Rules (Policy changes that affect the state of play)

- Title
- Sub-title
- Description

### Keepers (Characters/Actors/ Items that are needed to achieve Goals)

- Name

### Actions (events that occur in one play round, can affect anyone in the game or the person playing the Action)

- Title
- Description

### Goals (How to win the game, usually requires some combination of Keepers to be held by the player)
